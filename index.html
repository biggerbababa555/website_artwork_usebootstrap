      <h1 class="text-center">Chien，Chih-Kang ART</h1>
      <p class="text-center">Is life equal? Is it worthwhile? Does life have any meaning?
        I once saw a mouse that was run over to death by a car at the door of my house. I saw that it gradually deformed
        and distorted after being squeezed again and again from the normal state at the beginning. At the same time, it
        changed from plump to shriveled. There are phenomena such as overlapping, tearing, and scattering... life
        becomes like a piece of paper, leaving only shallow abstract shapes, and finally, the image and thickness
        dissipate into nothingness.
        In life, we are always used to look at everything from the perspective of standard and ego. I lived in the city
        since I was a child, and the animals I often see in my apartment are ants, cockroaches, mice and other so-called
        "pests". When an ant finds a group of ants and kills them wantonly, it will not connect with the serious issue
        of life, and there will be no ups and downs in mood. When seeing a mosquito sitting on the wall, it will kill it
        without thinking about it. After the hit, the heart is full of pure and complete joy and pleasure, and it seems
        to erase all the evidence of its existence, sometimes even the residue (corpse) remains on the wall, and I don’t
        care about it, as if it is more innocent. The matter of life is even more meaningless. Another example is in the
        villages, forests and mountains, you can often see creatures such as frogs and snakes who strayed into the road
        and died, and rows of frogs died under the wheels. Stop here; I have also seen social news, the last report was
        that someone was condemned by the society for abusing cats and dogs. Then there are food reports about beef,
        pork and mutton, etc., the boss proudly tells his exclusive secret recipe for cooking meat, and the people gorge
        on the food and are full of happiness. The same is life, why is there such a difference in treatment? The same
        is the disappearance of life, but can be viewed from different angles? Is it because of misleading and blinded
        by external factors or life is not equal? Take these events as an example. The starting point is that the author
        is not only curious about the state of matter being changed by a strong external force, but also extends to the
        further thinking behind it on issues such as the value of life itself, the relationship between organisms, and
        the meaning of life.
        Using flattening as the creative method, various states of deformation, twisting, overlapping, until
        disappearing and collapsing are extracted. In order to provide viewers with many aspects of meaning and private
        vocabulary, the creators try to reproduce the virtual real phenomenon through the works, explore the existence
        value of life itself, and spy on issues such as the absurd hidden class system and soft hegemony hidden in
        modern society. This real but unsolvable question is thrown at the readers in an attempt to create a collision
        and retain some space for self-evaluation, which is the main idea of this series of creations.</p>
